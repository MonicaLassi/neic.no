title: "Nordic Added Value for NeIC Collaborations"
summary: NeIC is a Nordic organization under NordForsk that coordinates efforts around research e-infrastructure in the Nordics in collaboration with the national efforts. Adding value through the incremental funding is important in deciding which collaborations NeIC should be involved with, both within the Nordics and outside the region. The additional value to the Nordic region that comes out of these efforts is what we call Nordic added value.

Nordic Added Value for NeIC Collaborations
===========================
NeIC is a Nordic organization that uses incremental funding to coordinate efforts around research e-infrastructure in the Nordics in support of excellence in research. Adding value through the incremental funding is important in deciding which collaborations NeIC should be involved with, both within the Nordics and outside the region. 

The additional value coming out of the efforts should be things that can be identified as important within the region and communicated to the stakeholders. We call this value the Nordic added value. As a result of the importance of Nordic added value within the context of NeIC, understanding and documenting Nordic added value is part of the 2020-2021 implementation plans for the NeIC 2020-2025 strategy. The major elements of Nordic added value for NeIC activities are 
- enabling excellence in research,
- adding value to the Nordics beyond national capabilities in e-infrastructure,
- increasing  competence and competitiveness in e-infrastructure and 
- acting as a global role model for e-infrastructure collaborations.

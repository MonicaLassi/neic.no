NeIC is seeking senior advisor(s) to strengthen its Executive Team
===========================

**NeIC is looking for one or two Senior Advisers at 60-80% to strengthen and renew its Executive Team. The NeIC Executive Team handles day-to-day management of NeIC. It operates as a virtual team and is chaired by the Director. Functions of the Executive Team include strategy implementation, project ownership (including Steering Group representation), project portfolio management (including supporting project managers and stimulating mutual learning and improvement), funding applications management, impacts analysis and reporting, facilitating the work of the NeIC Board and related expert groups, and NeIC office management.**

The tasks in this position could include participating in project steering and portfolio management, engaging with emerging Nordic research communities with common e-infrastructure needs and exploring Nordic opportunities for international collaboration. By expanding our capacity in these areas we aim to deliver added value to Nordic researchers. We can offer a wide variety of tasks which involves extensive contact with stakeholders such as research groups and specialist communities in the Nordic countries and internationally. The exact tasks will be defined after the successful candidate(s) have been found, considering also the candidate’s personal interests and competences.

The contract period for this position is four years. The start date for this position could be early January, 2021 or as agreed between NeIC and the successful candidate. It is expected that the candidate has, or is interested in, employment at a national e-infrastructure organization in a Nordic country (Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden) or one of its collaborating institutions. Staff are in this instance contracted to NeIC through a service agreement between the local employer institution and NeIC. 

NeIC appreciates the value of diverse teams in order to profit from a wide range of experience. The ideal candidate has excellent communication and collaboration skills, as well as expertise from development, deployment or operation of e-infrastructure services. Candidates must have a good command of English (both written and spoken). For such candidates NeIC will offer flexible (remote) work arrangement, stimulating colleagues, systematic training and practice in the PPS project model. Some travelling will be required.

The deadline for applications is November 8th, 2020. Questions may be directed to NeIC Director Gudmund Høst, gudmund.host@nordforsk.org, phone +47 95816846.

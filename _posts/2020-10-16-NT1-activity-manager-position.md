NeIC is seeking a manager for its NT1 activity
===========================

**NeIC is looking for an activity manager to lead the operations team that runs the Nordic distributed Tier-1 site for Large Hadron Collider (LHC) data storage and computing. The main focus of the NT1 activity manager is to lead the distributed NT1 team towards operating a high-quality and sustainable Nordic Tier-1 service within the WLCG.**

NeIC is looking for an activity manager to lead the operations team that runs the Nordic distributed Tier-1 site for LHC data storage and computing. This is a large-scale (>20 PetaByte) storage and computing effort that is part of a wider international infrastructure for storage and computing called Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG) which manages data on the ExaByte scale.

The main focus of the NT1 activity manager is to lead the distributed NT1 team towards operating a high-quality and sustainable Nordic Tier-1 service within the WLCG. This includes a range of tasks, from leadership, task prioritization to stakeholder engagement, but also classical project follow-up.
The functions and responsibilities of the Nordic Tier-1 activity manager include:

* Managing the NT1 activity and its resources in accordance with valid agreements, including the WLCG MoU fulfilment of the participating Nordic countries, the guidelines given by the NT1 steering group and design and functionality advice by the reference group.
* Building and leading a well functioning and motivated team distributed throughout the Nordics, including responsibility for well working internal communications, participating in the NT1 recruitment process, yearly development dialogues and task and responsibility revisions.
* Representing the NT1 activity in various contexts:

** Towards collaboration partners: Maintaining an active dialogue with other HPC centres in the Nordics including negotiations, acting as an ex-officio member of the Nordic LHC Grid (NLCG) Committee, updating Collaboration agreements and activity and subproject plans, as well as, providing regular progress reports for the activity and budget follow-up

** Towards WLCG: Taking part in conversations on how to serve the needs of the LHC experiments in the future of the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid, in close cooperation with the NLCG Committee and CERN Liaison.

** Towards other communities or collaborations: Engaging with them, gathering requirements, exploiting future opportunities, facilitating meetings and collaboration spaces.
* Working towards a continuous improvement of the Tier-1 service offering.

The contract period for this position is four years. The start date for this position is 1st January, 2021. The activity manager is expected to commit 50% of a full time equivalent to the Nordic Tier-1 (NT1). It is expected that the candidate has, or is interested in, employment at a national e-infrastructure organization in a Nordic country (Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden) or one of its collaborating institutions. Staff are contracted to NeIC through a service agreement between the local employer institution and NeIC. 

NeIC appreciates the value of diverse teams in order to profit from a wide range of experience. The ideal candidate has excellent communication and collaboration skills, as well as expertise from development, deployment or operation of e-infrastructure services. Candidates are expected to have a genuine interest in developing skills in project management for distributed teams and in providing value-added services to researchers. Candidates must have a good command of English (both written and spoken). For such candidates NeIC will offer flexible (remote) work arrangement, stimulating colleagues, systematic training and practice in the PPS project model. Some travelling will be required.

Current NeIC staff and new candidates are encouraged to apply.

The deadline for applications is 8. November, 2020. Questions may be directed to NeIC Director Gudmund HÃ¸st, gudmund.host@nordforsk.org, phone +47 95816846.

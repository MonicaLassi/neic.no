NeIC is seeking a Project Manager for Heilsa Tryggvedottir
===========================

**NeIC is seeking a Project Manager for its Heilsa Tryggvedottir project for a collaboration on a Nordic sensitive health research data infrastructure, which is expected to be launched in January 2021. The NeIC Heilsa project will productise and build on the NeIC Tryggve (2014â€“2020) project to increase interoperability of the Nordic e-Infrastructure to support data  management, including requirements for data quality, standards, technical infrastructure, while considering  ethical, legal, and societal issues (ELSI). Implementation of the e-Infrastructure solutions of the individual  countries must be coordinated to enable large-scale data analysis of federated data resources.  NeIC partners in the project are the ELIXIR nodes in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden, ETAIS (Estonian Scientific Compute Infrastructure),  and  the University of Iceland (observer status).**

NeIC is seeking a Project Manager to fill a 50% position for this 3 year project. We offer this part-time position primarily to staff at the national e-infrastructure provider institutions and their collaborating organizations. Staff in this instance are contracted to NeIC through a service agreement between the local employer institution and NeIC. 

The ideal candidate has excellent communication and collaboration skills, as well as expertise from development, deployment or operation of e-infrastructure services, particularly for sensitive or large scale distributed data. Candidates are expected to have a strong interest in developing skills in project management for distributed teams and in providing value-added services to researchers. For such candidates NeIC will offer flexible work arrangements, stimulating colleagues, systematic training and practice in the PPS project model. It is expected that the candidates are employed at a national e-infrastructure organization or one of its collaborating institutions. Candidates must have a good command of English (both written and spoken). The position entails a wide variety of interesting tasks and involves extensive contact with research groups and specialist communities in the Nordic countries and internationally. Some travelling will be required.

NeIC Project Managers report to the Project Owner(s). The general functions and responsibilities of the Project Manager include:
- Leading work in the distributed team towards deliveries and successful project completion.
- Maintaining an active requirements dialogue with stakeholders or reference groups.
- Developing and maintaining a detailed project plan.
- Selection of project staff.
- Providing regular progress reports about the project. 
- Producing the final report upon project completion.

We encourage both current NeIC staff and new candidates to apply. 

The deadline for applications is December 4, 2020. Questions may be directed to Rob Pennington, Special Advisor, Heilsa Project Owner (rlpennington1@gmail.com). Applications, including CV, should be submitted to recruitment@neic.no. If possible, applicants should include a support letter from current or previous employer organisation(-s).

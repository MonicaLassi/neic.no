NeIC is seeking a Technical Lead for its NT1 activity
===========================

**NeIC is looking for a technical lead for the distributed Nordic Tier-1 (NT1) site for LHC data storage and computing. The main focus of the NT1 technical lead is to define the technical directions that enable the NT1 to continue to deliver reliable and efficient services marked by excellent user satisfaction.**

NeIC is looking for a technical lead for the distributed Nordic Tier-1 (NT1) site for LHC data storage and computing. This is a large-scale (>20 PetaByte) storage and computing effort that is part of a wider international infrastructure for storage and computing called Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG) which manages data on the exabyte scale. The overall service level to be delivered to WLCG and the LHC experiments for the Nordic Tier-1 is defined by bilateral national Memorandum of Understandings with CERN. Of particular interest for the operation is the distributed storage, accounting, and other services run directly by the Nordic Tier-1, including ensuring that the local services run by the contributing sites make up a working Tier-1. Together all those parts should form a high-quality and sustainable Nordic Tier-1 site within the WLCG. 

The main focus of the NT1 technical lead is to define the technical directions that enable the NT1 to continue to deliver reliable and efficient services marked by excellent user satisfaction. This includes a range of tasks, from planning for the operational requirement for the Nordic WLCG Tier-1 services to technical coordination and consulting and leading necessary technology transition in a well-planned and formalized way. These tasks are carried out in agreement with the NT1 manager. The Technical lead reports to the NT1 manager.

The functions and responsibilities of the Nordic Tier-1 technical lead include:
* Defining the requirements and expectations for the operation of the Nordic WLCG Tier-1 services. This is to include planning for future WLCG upgrades and changes.
* Change management: Advising the NT1 manager in the planning, budgeting, preparation and execution of necessary technology transitions.
* Staying current on technical developments within the field and e-infrastructure in general.
* Supporting or replacing the NT1 manager in conversations towards WLCG on the future technical evolution of the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid.
* Technical coordination: Acting as an interface between sites, suppliers, and users in technical matters.
* Working together with the rest of the NT-1 team towards a continuous improvement of its service offering.

The contract period for this position is two years with possibility of renewal. The start date for this position is 1st January, 2021. The technical lead is expected to commit 50% of a full time equivalent to the Nordic Tier-1 during the first year, with the exact percentage to be adjusted after that. It is expected that the candidate has, or is interested in, employment at a national e-infrastructure organization in a Nordic country (Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden) or one of its collaborating institutions. Staff are contracted to NeIC through a service agreement between the local employer institution and NeIC. 

NeIC appreciates the value of diverse teams in order to profit from a wide range of experience. The ideal candidate has excellent communication and collaboration skills, as well as expertise from development, deployment or operation of e-infrastructure services. Candidates are expected to have a genuine interest in e-infrastructure technology and providing value-added services to researchers. Candidates must have a good command of English (both written and spoken). For such candidates NeIC will offer flexible (remote) work arrangement, stimulating colleagues, systematic training and practice in the PPS project model. Some travelling will be required.

Current NeIC staff and new candidates are encouraged to apply.

The deadline for applications is 8. November, 2020. Questions may be directed to NeIC Director Gudmund HÃ¸st, gudmund.host@nordforsk.org, phone +47 95816846. Applications including CV should be submitted to openpositions@neic.no. If possible, applicants should include a support letter from current or previous employer organisation(-s).

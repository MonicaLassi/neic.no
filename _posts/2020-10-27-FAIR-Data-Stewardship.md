The FAIR Data Stewardship training was kicked off this week
===========================

**The course, organised by NeIC, CSC, SNIC and SND, will run over five weeks (equivalent to 5 days) and will provide the much needed foundational skills for competent data stewards and data managers in the Nordic countries with knowledge of the FAIR principles and their application.**

The third Nordic course on FAIR data stewardship started yesterday with over 95 participants registered. This course is part of a series of training events organised by NeIC in collaboration with national providers to advance the expertise on FAIR data stewardship in the Nordic region.  

The course will run over five weeks (equivalent to 5 days) and will provide the much needed foundational skills for competent data stewards and data managers in the Nordic countries with knowledge of the FAIR principles and their application. The course is held by trainers from Phortos Consultants and provides a broad, but fairly technical introduction to data stewardship. Exercises and assignments will allow participants hands-on experience and assignments to help identify knowledge gaps. The event is organised by NeIC in collaboration with CSC in Finland, SND and SNIC in Sweden. 

The original event was scheduled as two face to face trainings held in Sweden and Finland â€“ but was changed to an online series of lectures and excercises due to the changing restrictions in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic.
